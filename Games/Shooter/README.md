# Shooter

Adaptation of an XNA tutorial from Microsoft. There is a lot of comments simply because they were part of the tutorial.

The original tutorial seemed unfinished as it provided assets for a main menu and a game over screen, but the tutorial only covered the gameplay part.

I added debug visualization of the bounding box, since the original tutorial had misplaced the projectile origin and some collision bounding boxes were off if I remember correctly.
